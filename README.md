# Polyphony Complexity in Renaissance Masses
Python code to evaluate the quality of auditory streaming complexity in symbolic music files of Renaissance vocal polyphony.

One notebook extracting the measurements of streaming complexity from a corpus of midi and humdrum files.

One notebook generating example graphs and analyses results on the streaming complexity features with factors such as year of composition, composer, and movement of the mass ordinary.

This analysis uses data from the Josquin Research Project and the RenComp7 project.

And was performed in collaboration with Julie Cumming while Finn Upham as a postdoc with DDMAL.

A paper has been submitted on this work.
